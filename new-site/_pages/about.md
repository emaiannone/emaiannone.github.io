Hello, I'm Emanuele, a **Computer Science** Ph.D. student at [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it/), in Italy. I'm part of the extraordinary family of the [SeSa Lab](https://sesalabunisa.github.io). I was born in Salerno, Italy, on September 1st, 1996.

I'm currently at the final year of my Ph.D. program, revolving around the analysis of **Software Vulnerabilities** in the field of **Software Maintenance and Evolution**. I'm adivised by [Prof. Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea De Lucia](https://docenti.unisa.it/003241/home).

My research concerns the use of empirical method for dealing with software vulnerabilities, such as building vulnerability prediction models, assessing their risk automatically, and devising new security testing techniques. So, my research falls within Empirical Software Engineering, a sub-domain of Software Engineering focusing on conducting experiments on software systems and developers. To summarize, my main research topics are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Mining Software Repositories & Software Analytics  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Machine Learning for Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Software Maintenance & Evolution  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Search-based Software Engineering

I have also worked on topics like:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Green Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Program Comprehension  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Organizational Aspects of Software Engineering

In September 2020, I received the M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Exploit Generation of Known Java API vulnerabilities*** advised by Prof. F. Palomba and Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude) . Two years before, In July 2018, I received the B.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Refactoring of Android-specific Energy Smells*** advised by Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude).

I have always been fond of video games, especially role-playing games (RPG), but since my professional life got new perspectives, I had to change my habits, so I got into anime and TV series. My favourite video game series are *Final Fantasy* and *Pok√©mon*, and I'm a great fan of *Attack on Titan* and *Jojo's Bizzare Adventures* TV show.
