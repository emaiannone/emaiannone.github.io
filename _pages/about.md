Hello, I am Emanuele (E-muh-nuh-el-E), Predoctoral Researcher at the [Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)](https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/startseite), Germany, and Ph.D. Candidate in **Computer Science** at the [University of Salerno (UNISA)](https://www.unisa.it/), Italy. In TUHH, I am part of the [Institute of Software Security (SoftSec)](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/institute), while at UNISA I was academically raised by [Prof. Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea De Lucia](https://docenti.unisa.it/003241/home) at the [Software Engineering (SeSa) Lab](https://sesalabunisa.github.io).

I am 100% Salernitan: I was born in Salerno, grew up in Salerno, went to school in Salerno, and graduated in Salerno! I am a proud millennial, born in 1996.

My research revolves around analyzing **software vulnerabilities** in the field of **Software Maintenance and Evolution**.
In particular, I am working on **mining and generating security tests and exploits for vulnerabilities** and **automated vulnerability repair**.
My approach to research consists of employing empirical methods for dealing with software vulnerabilities, such as building vulnerability prediction models, assessing their risk automatically, and devising new security testing techniques. My research falls within Empirical Software Engineering, a sub-domain of Software Engineering focusing on conducting experiments on software systems and developers.

To summarize, my main research topics are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Mining Software Repositories & Software Analytics  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Machine Learning for Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Search-based Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Software Reengineering

I have also worked on side topics like:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Green Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Program Comprehension  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Organizational Aspects in Software Engineering

In September 2020, I received the M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at the University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Exploit Generation of Known Java API vulnerabilities*** advised by Prof. F. Palomba and Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude). Two years before, In July 2018, I received a B.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at the University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Refactoring of Android-specific Energy Smells*** advised by Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude).

I have always been fond of video games, especially role-playing games (RPG), playing for hours daily. But since my professional life got new perspectives, I had to change my habits, so I had to switch to more flexible hobbies: anime and TV series. My favorite video game series are *Final Fantasy* and *Pokémon*, and I am a great fan of *Attack on Titan* and *Jojo's Bizzare Adventures* TV shows.
