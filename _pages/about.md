Hello, I am Emanuele (E-muh-nuh-el-E), Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)](https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/startseite), Germany, and Ph.D. candidate in **Computer Science** at the [University of Salerno (UNISA)](https://www.unisa.it/), Italy. In TUHH, I am part of the [Institute of Software Security (SoftSec)](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/institute), while in UNISA I was academically raised by [Prof. Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea De Lucia](https://docenti.unisa.it/003241/home) at the [Software Engineering (SeSa) Lab](https://sesalabunisa.github.io).

I am 100% Salernitan: born in Salerno, grown up in Salerno, went to school in Salerno, graduated in Salerno! I am a proud millenial, born in 1996.

My research revolves around the analysis of **software vulnerabilities** in the field of **Software Maintenance and Evolution**.
In particular, I am working on **mining and generating security tests and exploits for vulnerabilities**, as well as **automated vulnerability repair**.
More in general, my research approach consists of empirical methods for dealing with software vulnerabilities, such as building vulnerability prediction models, assessing their risk automatically, and devising new security testing techniques. My research falls within Empirical Software Engineering, a sub-domain of Software Engineering focusing on conducting experiments on software systems and developers.

To summarize, my main research topics are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Mining Software Repositories & Software Analytics  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Machine Learning for Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Search-based Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Software Reengineering

I have also worked on side topics like:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Green Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Program Comprehension  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Organizational Aspects in Software Engineering

In September 2020, I received the M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Exploit Generation of Known Java API vulnerabilities*** advised by Prof. F. Palomba and Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude) . Two years before, In July 2018, I received the B.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Refactoring of Android-specific Energy Smells*** advised by Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude).

I have always been fond of video games, especially role-playing games (RPG), playing like hours each day. But since my professional life got new perspectives, I had to change my habits, so I had to switch on more flexible hobbies: anime and TV series. My favourite video game series are *Final Fantasy* and *Pokémon*, and I am a great fan of *Attack on Titan* and *Jojo's Bizzare Adventures* TV show.
