Hello, I am Emanuele (*/Eh-maa-noo-eh-leh/*), Postdoctoral Researcher (Research Assistant) at the [Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)](https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/startseite), Germany. I am part of the [Institute of Software Security (SoftSec)](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/institute), where I work on mining and creating **proof of vulnerabilities** (e.g., security test cases, exploits, etc.) and developing novel **automated vulnerability repair** solutions, contributing to the Horizon EU project [Sec4AI4Sec](https://www.sec4ai4sec-project.eu/).

In February 2024, I earned a Ph.D. in **Computer Science** at the [University of Salerno (UNISA)](https://www.unisa.it/), Italy. I defended a thesis on **software vulnerabilities** in the field of **Software Maintenance and Evolution** (thesis title: *There's Something about Vulnerabilities: Empirical Comprehension and Novel Automated Approaches*), supervised (and academically raised) by [Prof. Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/) at the [Software Engineering (SeSa) Lab](https://sesalabunisa.github.io).

My research approach involves employing empirical methods to address software vulnerabilities, such as building vulnerability prediction models, automatically assessing their risk, and devising new security testing techniques. My research falls within Empirical Software Engineering, a sub-domain of Software Engineering that focuses on conducting experiments on software systems and developers.

My main research topics are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Mining Software Repositories & Software Analytics  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: AI for Software Security Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Search-based Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Software Reengineering

I have also worked on topics like:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Green Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Program Comprehension  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Organizational Aspects in Software Engineering

In September 2020, I earned an M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at the University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automated Exploit Generation of Known Java API vulnerabilities*** advised by Prof. F. Palomba and Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude). Two years earlier, In July 2018, I earned an B.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at the University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automated Refactoring of Android-specific Energy Smells*** advised by Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude).

I am 100% Salernitan. I was born in [Salerno](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salerno), grew up there, and attended school there. I am a proud millennial, born in 1996. I have always been fond of video games, especially role-playing games (RPG), and I used to play them for hours each day. But since my professional life has given me new perspectives, I have had to change my habits and switch to more flexible hobbies: anime and TV series. My favorite video game series are *Final Fantasy* and *Pokémon*, and I am a great fan of *Attack on Titan* and *Jojo's Bizzare Adventures* TV show.
