Hello, I am Emanuele (*/Eh-maa-noo-èh-leh/*), Postdoctoral Researcher (formally, a *Research Assistant*) at the [Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)](https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/startseite), Germany.

I am part of the [Institute of Software Security (SoftSec)](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/institute), where I dedicate my effort (and passion) to **security testing**. I am involved in the Horizon EU project [Sec4AI4Sec](https://www.sec4ai4sec-project.eu/), where I work on **automated mining and generation of security unit tests** and developing novel **AI-driven vulnerability repair** solutions.

In February 2024, I earned a Ph.D. in **Computer Science** at the [University of Salerno (UNISA)](https://www.unisa.it/), Italy. I defended a thesis on **software vulnerabilities** in the context of **software maintenance and evolution** (thesis title: *There's Something about Vulnerabilities: Empirical Comprehension and Novel Automated Approaches*), supervised (and academically raised) by [Prof. Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/) at the [Software Engineering (SeSa) Lab](https://sesalabunisa.github.io).

My research is entirely rooted in Empirical Software Engineering. In this area, I focused on **software security**, in particular to *security testing*, *automated exploit generation*, *mining vulnerability-related data from software repositories*, and *vulnerability assessment*. I adopt AI tools and techniques on a daily basis, without forgetting the (good ol') heuristic and more traditional approaches.

To summarize, my main research topics are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Security Vulnerability Testing  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Mining Software Repositories & Software Analytics (applied to vulnerability-related data)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: AI for Software Security Engineering  

I have (re-)started working in these topics:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Automated Exploit Generation  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Automatic Vulnerability Repair  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Secure Code Generation (and Security of AI-generated Code)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Vulnerability Data Synthesis  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Human (i.e., Developer) Aspects in Software Security  

I have also worked on some others topics in the past:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:grey_exclamation: Exploitability Prediction and Assessment  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:grey_exclamation: Vulnerability Prediction  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:grey_exclamation: Program Comprehension  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:grey_exclamation: Software Refactoring  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:grey_exclamation: Search-based Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:grey_exclamation: Organizational Aspects in Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:grey_exclamation: Mobile App Energy Consumption

In September 2020, I earned an M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at the University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automated Exploit Generation of Known Java API vulnerabilities*** advised by Prof. F. Palomba and Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude). Two years earlier, in July 2018, I earned a B.Sc. Degree in the same study course at the same university, defending a thesis on ***Automated Refactoring of Android-specific Energy Smells*** advised by Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude).

I am 100% Salernitan. I was born in [Salerno](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salerno), grew up there, and want to school there. I am a proud millennial, born in 1996. I have always been fond of video games, especially Japanese role-playing games (JRPG), and I used to play them for many hours a day. But since my professional life has given me new perspectives, I have had to change my habits and switch to more flexible hobbies, though sometimes I go back doing some retro gaming (nostalgia kicks in).

If you want to hear me talking for an indefinite amount of time, just introduce the topic *Pokémon*. If you want to hear me only for few hours, you can pick one among *Final Fantasy*, *Attack on Titan*, *Steins;Gate*, *Dragon Ball* and *JoJo's Bizarre Adventures* (yeah, all nerdy Japanese stuff).

Random facts about me:

- Apparently people have trouble with my last name. They keep misspelling it... It's an "I" (the letter after H), not a lowercase "L". It would be weird to have a last name staring with a lowercase letter, isn't it?
- I am former World of Warcraft player with a Human Retribution Paladin (*For the Alliance*, deal with it).
- I am quite fond of competitive Pokémon video games (VGC). Actually, for a short period in 2017 I also took part of a few local tournaments... well, not winning anything, but at least I passed the initial rounds, somehow!
