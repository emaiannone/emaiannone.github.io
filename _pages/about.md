Hello, I am Emanuele (*/Eh-maa-noo-eh-leh/*), Postdoctoral Researcher (Research Assistant) at the [Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)](https://www.tuhh.de/tuhh/startseite), Germany. I am part of the [Institute of Software Security (SoftSec)](https://www.tuhh.de/softsec/institute), and work on the Horizon EU Project [*Sec4AI4Sec*](https://www.sec4ai4sec-project.eu/), where I work on mining and creating **proof of vulnerabilities** (e.g., security test cases, exploits, etc.) and developing novel **automated vulnerability repair** solutions.

In February 2024, I earned the Ph.D. in Computer Science at the **Computer Science** at the [University of Salerno (UNISA)](https://www.unisa.it/), Italy. I defended a thesis on **software vulnerabilities** in the field of **Software Maintenance and Evolution** (thesis title: *There's Something about Vulnerabilities: Empirical Compehension and Novel Automated Approaches*), supervised (and academically raised) by [Prof. Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/) at the [Software Engineering (SeSa) Lab](https://sesalabunisa.github.io).

My approach to research consists of employing empirical methods for dealing with software vulnerabilities, such as building vulnerability prediction models, assessing their risk automatically, and devising new security testing techniques. My research falls within Empirical Software Engineering, a sub-domain of Software Engineering focusing on conducting experiments on software systems and developers.

My main research topics are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Mining Software Repositories & Software Analytics  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: AI for Software Security Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Search-based Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Software Reengineering

I have also worked on topics like:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Green Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Program Comprehension  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Organizational Aspects in Software Engineering

Going more back in time, In September 2020, I received the M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Exploit Generation of Known Java API vulnerabilities*** advised by Prof. F. Palomba and Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude). Two years before, In July 2018, I received the B.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Refactoring of Android-specific Energy Smells*** advised by Prof. A. De Lucia (110/110 cum laude).

I am 100% Salernitan: born in [Salerno](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salerno), grown up in Salerno, went to school in Salerno, graduated in Salerno! I am a proud millenial, born in 1996. I have always been fond of video games, especially role-playing games (RPG), playing like hours each day. But since my professional life got new perspectives, I had to change my habits, so I had to switch on more flexible hobbies: anime and TV series. My favourite video game series are *Final Fantasy* and *Pokémon*, and I am a great fan of *Attack on Titan* and *Jojo's Bizzare Adventures* TV show.
