What a nice way to wake up with an journal paper acceptance!
The paper [**"Just-in-Time Software Vulnerability Detection: Are We There Yet?"**](publications#j3) has been accepted at [Journal of System and Software](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/journal-of-systems-and-software).

In this work we investigate on the feasibility of vulnerability prediction at commit-level (just-in-time).
In some respects, results are not so bad, but still more effort has to be invested in this topic.

:sunglasses: Another step toward my Ph.D. thesis.

I want to thank to my co-authors: Francesco Lomio, Andrea De Lucia, [Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/), and Valentina Lenarduzzi.
