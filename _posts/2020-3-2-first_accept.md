My [first paper](works#icpc2020) has been accepted at ICPC 2020! :smile:

I'm really excited for my first accepted paper.
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, ICPC (International Conference on Program Comprehension) 2020 will be held online 13-15 July 2020.

This paper is a tool demo of [aDoctor](https://github.com/emaiannone/aDoctor), an Intellij Plugin that I have been developing since my BSc thesis.

I know that there are still a lot of things to implement and improve, but step-by-step it is growing!
