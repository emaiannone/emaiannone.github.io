My [first paper](works#icpc2020refactoring) has been accepted at [ICPC 2020](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icpc-2020)!
I am very excited! :smile:

Due to COVID-19 pandemic, ICPC (International Conference on Program Comprehension) 2020
will be held online 13-15 July 2020.

This paper is a *tool demo* of [aDoctor](https://github.com/SeSa-Lab/aDoctor), an Intellij Plugin
that I have been developing since my B.Sc. thesis.

I know that there are still a lot of things to implement and improve, but it is growing little-by-little!
