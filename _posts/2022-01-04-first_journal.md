This 2022 couldn't have started better: the paper [**"The Secret Life of Software Vulnerabilities: A Large-Scale Empirical Study"**](works#j1) has been accepted at 
none other than [IEEE Transaction on Software Engineering](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/ts)!

This work started at the beginning of my Ph.D., toward the end of 2020. When we decided to submit to TSE I didn't have much hope, as I was (and still I am) so immature: how they could accept an article like this? When the major revision came, the hopes were restored, and I worked really hard to try to solve all the reviewers requests... and now we are here! All the efforts invested were not in vain.

Sincere thanks to my collaborators, Roberta Guadagni, Filomena Ferrucci, Andrea De Lucia, and [Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/).
