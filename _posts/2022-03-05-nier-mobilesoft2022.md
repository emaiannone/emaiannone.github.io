Good news: our paper [**"Predicting The Energy Consumption Level of Java Classes in Android Apps: An Exploratory Analysis"**](publications#c4) has been accepted at [MobileSoft 2022](https://conf.researchr.org/home/mobilesoft-2022). 

In this short paper we present a preliminary idea of prediction the energy consumption of Android native app component (classes) by levearing only static predictors, such as code metrics.

We experimented this with a multi-class classification task, obtaining... not so good results. Disappointed, but not surprised!

Thanks to my co-authors [Manuel De Stefano](https://mdestefano.github.io/), [Fabiano Pecorelli](https://fabiano-pecorelli.github.io/), and Andrea De Lucia.
