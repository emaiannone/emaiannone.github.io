Due to COVID-19 pandemic and the online rearrangement of [ICPC 2020 <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:16px"></i>](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icpc-2020),
I had the opportunity to personally present my [first paper](works#c1)
in a live summary + Q/A session :smile:

For the occasion, I also prepared a pre-recorded presentation, available on YouTube
[here <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:16px"></i>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXFXpD5FqWA&t=141s).

This was my first time I held a public speech outside my University,
and I hope there will be more chances in my professional future!
