After (fortunately just) one round of rejection, my paper **"Toward Automated Exploit Generation for
Known Vulnerabilities in Open-Source Libraries"**, made in collaboration with Dario Di Nucci, Antonino Sabetta and Andrea De Lucia, was accepted at [ERA Track <i class="fa fa-external-link" style="font-size:16px"></i>](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icpc-2021/icpc-2021-era#event-overview) at ICPC 2021!

This is very important milestone for my Ph. D. since it is the natural extension of my master thesis work and lays the foundation for my Ph. D. thesis.
This work is going to be extended soon, stay tuned :wink:!
