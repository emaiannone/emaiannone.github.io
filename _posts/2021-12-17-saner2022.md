Wonderful news this morning: the paper [**"Toward Understanding the Impact of Refactoring
on Program Comprehension"**](works#c3) has been accepted at the Research track at [SANER 2022](https://saner2022.uom.gr/).

I really hope this is the time when I'll take part to my very first conference physically. 

Deep thanks to my collaborators, [Giulia Sellitto](https://giuliasellitto7.github.io/), Zadia Codabux, Valentina Lenarduzzi, Andrea De Lucia, [Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/), and Filomena Ferrucci.
