    abstract = {Mobile applications are major means to perform daily actions, including social and emergency connectivity. However, their usability is threatened by energy consumption that may be impacted by code smells i.e., symptoms of bad implementation and design practices. In particular, researchers derived a set of mobile-specific code smells resulting in increased energy consumption of mobile apps and removing such smells through refactoring can mitigate the problem. In this paper, we extend and revise aDoctor, a tool that we previously implemented to identify energy-related smells. On the one hand, we present and implement automated refactoring solutions to those smells. On the other hand, we make the tool completely open-source and available in Android Studio as a plugin published in the official store. The video showing the tool in action is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1c2EhVXiKis},
