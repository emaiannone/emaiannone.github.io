# About Me

:wave: Hello, I'm Emanuele Iannone, a **Computer Science** Ph.D. student at [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it/) (Italy), and I'm part of the extraordinary family of [SeSa Lab](https://sesalabunisa.github.io/).
I was born in Salerno, Italy, on 1st September 1996.

:pencil: I'm currently at the second year of my Ph.D. program. My research resolves around the analysis of **Software Vulnerabilities** in the field of **Software Maintenance and Evolution**, advised by [Prof. Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea De Lucia](https://docenti.unisa.it/003241/home).
My main research topic concerns the analysis of current V&V practices to deal with software vulnerabilities and, more in general, security issues.

:mortar_board: I received (110/110 cum laude) the M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at
University of Salerno in September 2020, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Exploit Generation of Known Java API vulnerabilities*** advised by Prof. F. Palomba and Prof. A. De Lucia.  
:mortar_board: In July 2018, I received (110/110 magna cum laude) the B.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Refactoring of Android-specific Energy Smells*** advised by Prof. A. De Lucia.

My research activity is around Empirical Software Engineering, a sub-domain of Software Engineering focusing on conducting experiments on software systems and developers. My main research interests are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Green Software Engineering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Mining Software Repositories  

:nerd_face: I have always been fond of video gamers, especially role-playing games (RPG), but since my professional life got new perspectives, I (sadly) had to change my habits, so I got into anime and TV series.  
My favourite video game series are *Final Fantasy* and *Pok√©mon*, while I'm a great fan on *Attack on Titan* TV show.
