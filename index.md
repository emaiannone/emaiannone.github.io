# About Me

:wave: Hello, I'm Emanuele Iannone, a **Computer Science** Ph.D. student at [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it/) (Italy), and I'm part of the extraordinary family of [SeSa Lab](https://sesalabunisa.github.io).
I was born in Salerno, Italy, on 1st September 1996.

:pencil: I'm currently at the third year of my Ph.D. program. My research resolves around the analysis of **Software Vulnerabilities** in the field of **Software Maintenance and Evolution**, advised by [Prof. Fabio Palomba](https://fpalomba.github.io/) and [Prof. Andrea De Lucia](https://docenti.unisa.it/003241/home).
My main research topic concerns empirical studies on software vulnerabilities, predicting software vulnerabilities with machine learning, and assessing the risk associated to vulnerabilities. Hence, my research activity falls within Empirical Software Engineering, a sub-domain of Software Engineering focusing on conducting experiments on software systems and developers. My main research topics are:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Mining Software Repositories & Software Analytics  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Machine Learning for Software Engineering
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Software Maintenance & Evolution  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:bangbang: Search-based Software Engineering

I have also worked on other topics:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Green Software Engineering  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Program Comprehension  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:exclamation: Organizational Aspects of Software Engineering

:mortar_board: In September 2020, I received (110/110 cum laude) the M.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Exploit Generation of Known Java API vulnerabilities*** advised by Prof. F. Palomba and Prof. A. De Lucia.  
:mortar_board: In July 2018, I received (110/110 cum laude) the B.Sc. Degree in Computer Science at University of Salerno, defending a thesis on ***Automatic Refactoring of Android-specific Energy Smells*** advised by Prof. A. De Lucia.

:nerd_face: I have always been fond of video games, especially role-playing games (RPG), but since my professional life got new perspectives, I had to change my habits, so I got into anime and TV series. My favourite video game series are *Final Fantasy* and *Pok√©mon*, and I'm a great fan of *Attack on Titan* and *Jojo's Bizzare Adventures* TV show.
