**[C2] Toward Automated Exploit Generation for
Known Vulnerabilities in Open-Source Libraries**  
**E. Iannone**, D. Di Nucci, A. Sabetta, A. De Lucia.  
**To appear** In Proceedings of the 29th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2021),
Madrid, Spain, 2021 (virtual).
[[preprint]](download/papers/c2.pdf)

>Modern software applications, including commercial ones, extensively use Open-Source Software (OSS) components, accounting for 90% of software products on the market. This has serious security implications, mainly because developers rely on non-updated versions of libraries affected by software vulnerabilities. 
>[...] In this work, we propose SIEGE, a novel automatic exploit generation approach based on genetic algorithms, which generates test cases that execute the methods in a library known to contain a vulnerability. These test cases [...] are also useful for security researchers to better understand how the vulnerability could be exploited in practice.

**[C1] Refactoring Android-specific Energy Smells: A Plugin for Android Studio**  
**E. Iannone**, F. Pecorelli, D. Di Nucci, F. Palomba, A. De Lucia.  
In Proceedings of the 28th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2020),
Seoul, South Korea, 2020 (virtual).

>Mobile applications are major means to perform daily actions, including social and emergency
>connectivity. However, their usability is threatened by energy consumption that may be impacted
>by code smells. [...] In this paper, we extend and revise aDoctor,
>a tool that we previously implemented to identify energy-related smells.

## :briefcase: Teaching Assistance

I have been practising as *tutor* for many Computer Science B. Sc. courses at University of Salerno.
I offer support for course projects, give additional theoretical and practical insights
and be available for any questions and request for clarification.
